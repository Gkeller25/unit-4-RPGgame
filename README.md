RPG Game:

The RPG Game is a Star Wars themed game where the player chooses from 6 possible characters for them to play. Each Character has attack points which grow each time they attack. The player then proceeds to choose the first of 3 opponents they must face(opponents will be in the opposite affliation than the character chosen as the player) Once the Player's character is chosen and the first opponent is chosen the battle can begin by clicking the attack button until either the player loses or defeats the opponent. If the latter happens player must select next opponent and this will repeat until either the player loses the game or wins. Once the game is over to start again just press the reset button.
